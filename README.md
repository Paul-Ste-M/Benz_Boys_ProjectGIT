# Benz_Boys_ProjectGIT
This is a music app that will include songs to play for a selected instrument of the users choosing. It will also have an option to create songs to play for the user as well. The app will also have a music game where it will play the chord, and then play a random one, allowing the user to choose the correct chord to help with training and practicing their chosen instrument. The app is targeted towards users with minimal/beginner music experience, and it is aimed to be an easy and ideal environment for music to be learned efficiently and effectively.
